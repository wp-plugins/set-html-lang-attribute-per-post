## The problem this plugin solves

Wordpress allows us to specify site-wide language defaults like so:

`<meta http-equiv="content-language" content="es">`

The problem comes about if you have blog posts in various languages. Personally I write posts in either English or Norwegian. And since English is set as the site-wide language posts that are in Norwegian end up looking kinda weird due to weirdly placed `-` (hyphenations).

## Solution

The solution is to add more specific html `lang` attributes when needed.

`<article id="" class="" lang="vi">`

For example this specifies that the post is in Vietnamese. This plugin enables a meta box when editing posts where you may specify the post's language.

## Contributing

This plugin was made in a jiffy. But by all means do suggest improvements. For instance the plugin obviously lacks testing code.
